# Git Test Repo!

This is just a test of repo for me to use with git to manage my local 
projects in a more efficient manner. Maybe in the future, all my projects
will be managed through git, either using local or remote (Github) 
repositories. This README is also used for testing out GitHub's flavor of
markdown.

**How about a list**

* Green

* Red

**Text features**

That is __awesome__ `monospace` *italic* 

**How about a ruler?**

**And this is the end**

**Test out some symbols!**
