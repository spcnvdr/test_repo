#Git Test Repo!

This is just a test of playing with git to manage my local projects
in a more efficient manner. I hope that in the future, all my projects
will be managed through git, either using local or remote (Github) 
repositories. I should make a Github account, but I am lazy and unsure
if I am ready to release any of my projects to the world. 

**How about a list**

* Green

* Red

**Syntax highlighting**

I had no idea that vim knew about markdown syntax and would highlight it 
for me. That is __awesome__ `monospace` *italic* 

**How about a ruler?**

**And this is the end**

Test out the symbols!
